# Code Linting

## Overview

We use [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/) for most of our linting, but we use [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org) separately for Ruby to support Minitest and Rails cops.

Linters help by:
- Catching syntax errors, undefined variables, and unused code early
- Ensuring consistent code style across teams and projects
- Providing automated quality improvements and best practices
- Saving time in code review and debugging

## Setup

Add linting to your project:

```bash
way_of_working init code_linting
```

This copies organisational coding standards and GitHub Actions workflows to your project.

{: .note }
For Xcode projects, a SwiftLint build phase is automatically added to the project config.

## Usage

Run linting locally:

```bash
way_of_working exec code_linting
```

executes both MegaLinter and RuboCop against your code.

## Configuration

Language-specific configs are in the project root or `.github/linters/`. See [linters.md](linters.md) for the complete list.

To customise for your project, talk to the code standards team and modify the config files as needed, keeping changes minimal and well documented. Changes to linting configs require Pull Request review by the code-standards-team.

## Handling Exceptions

On the rare occasions when linters flag false positives, turn off rules with comments giving your justification:

```python
# pylint: disable=line-too-long - URL cannot be broken
LONG_URL = "https://example.com/very/long/path/..."
```

## Documentation

Generate project documentation:

```bash
way_of_working exec document
```

{: .important }
If you disagree with any linter or coding style, please fork the Way of Working code linting [repository](https://github.com/HealthDataInsight/way_of_working-code_linting-hdi) and create a pull request with your proposed changes. The current standards are a starting point intended to evolve with team consensus.
